#### 2015
Initially it should be a DCF77 driven clock. But the reception was too bad everywhere
the clock could be placed. Hence a Raspberry Pi 1B was used to send the time via UART
to the microcontroller.

#### 2020
The clock is now a R&D platform for the VoCore2.

UART1 is used to communicate with the clock.
